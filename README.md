Smart City Dashboard for Traffic and Utility Monitoring 
City administrators need insights into traffic flow, energy usage, and other vital metrics to 
optimize city management. This challenge involves creating a dashboard that visualizes real
time data on traffic, utilities, and other key city operations. By analyzing this data, city officials 
can reduce congestion, prevent power outages, and improve resource distribution. This 
solution would support efficient urban management, leading to smarter, more responsive 
cities.
